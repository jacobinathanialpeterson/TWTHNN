import os, sys

# 1) Point sys.path to your server/app.py folder:
sys.path.append("home/cyranicusmcneff.helioho.st/httpdocs/server")
# 2) Import and expose the Flask app as "application":
from server.app import app as application

# 3) Optional: force a fixed secret key (sessions, CSRF, etc.)
application.secret_key = "key"

# (You donâ€™t need application_root since it's mounted at "/")
